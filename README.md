# Web Development and Microservices: From Monoliths to Modular Systems

Modern web development is no longer just about building pages and connecting them to a database. It’s about designing systems that scale, evolve, and survive change. As applications grow in complexity — whether they’re e-commerce platforms, financial dashboards, or real-time analytics tools — architecture becomes as important as code.
This is where microservices enter the picture.

# The Evolution of Web Architecture

In the early days, most applications were built as monoliths: one codebase, one deployment, one tightly coupled system. Everything — authentication, payments, product catalog, notifications — lived inside the same application.
That approach works beautifully at small scale. It’s simple. It’s fast to build. It’s easy to deploy.

- But as the system grows, problems start appearing:
- Small changes require redeploying the entire app
- A bug in one feature can crash everything
- Scaling one component means scaling the entire system
- Development teams block each other

To solve these growing pains, engineers began splitting applications into smaller, independent services — each responsible for a single domain.

That’s microservices.
